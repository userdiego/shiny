This Shiny App allows to have a visual feel of what goes on when performing power calculations.
It assumes a two-sample t test will be used, and that both samples have the same size.
You must input the two means to compare, and the total sample size, the alhpa error and the standard deviation.
The app then plots the kernel density for random t distributions for both means and performs a power calculation.
